just a place for us to write things down
kk thx

hmm okay.  We need to have some stuff.  for the dict, i think we need to have a dictionary of dictionaries
where keys are user ids and values are a dict of the shops that they own, where the values are the names of the shops so that i can access them from a second
json file dictionary where the keys are names and the values are the shop things like items and so on.  

kk that's done. 


next up:  placing orders and notifying the shop owner when they come online.  

Thinky typing:  How to structure the dictionary:  I am going to have one file, orders.json.  The keys are going to be user ids of who it is going to, with the values
as dictionaries including all of the relevant information, such as the orderer, quantity, total price, and the item being bought. Wait a second.
i need a second dict.  outgoing orders.  because then i can make it work more nicely, and be able to scroll through my dicts more easily.  wait.  no..  GRAAA
i will think about this after maths.    

I think i've got it sorted
