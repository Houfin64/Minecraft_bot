just a place for us to write things down
kk thx

hmm okay.  We need to have some stuff.  for the dict, i think we need to have a dictionary of dictionaries
where keys are user ids and values are a dict of the shops that they own, where the values are the names of the shops so that i can access them from a second
json file dictionary where the keys are names and the values are the shop things like items and so on.
